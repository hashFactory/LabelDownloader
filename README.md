# LabelDownloader

Project repo for LabelDownloader

Goal is to have a web service (maybe) where you give it a Discogs label ID and it gives back either a youtube or a spotify playlist with all the releases organized chronologically.

The main code will be in discogs.py but right now everything is in disc_int.py for prototyping.
